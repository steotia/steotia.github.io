The lack of access to learning opportunities is a complex and multidimensional problem. It impacts the lives of millions of children on a daily basis. In response, Nandan Nilekani, Rohini Nilekani and Shankar Maruwada co-founded EkStep, a not-for-profit initiative to gather partners on a universal, collaborative platform to reimagine learning opportunities for every child.

EkStep is a utility; an enabler. Our layered, modular platform allows for the co-creation of solutions that are of non-linear, agile and scalable. It amplifies the impact of the current educational ecosystem through partner networking.
